# FAQ

## Questions about possibility

###  Q: Whether the OpenNI2 SDK supports color camera of UVC protocol

Currently not supported, for devices whose color camera in the sensor is UVC protocol, C++ recommends using the VideoCapture class provided in OpenCV to open the color camera and read the color stream. If the Android platform Orbbec module RGB is a UVC device, it needs to be opened with a third-party libuvc application. libuvc uses the GitHub-based open source framework UVCCamera: https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera.
